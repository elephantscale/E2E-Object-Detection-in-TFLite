## About the notebooks
- `Fruits_Detection_Data_Prep.ipynb`: Shows how to prepare a object detection dataset in order to train it with the TFOD API in non-eager mode.
- `Training_MobileDet_Custom_Dataset.ipynb`: Shows how to fine-tune a MobileDet model to detect localize and detect fruits. It also shows how to optimize the fine-tuned model with TensorFlow Lite and run inference with the optimized model. 

**TODO**: Add a link to the MobileDet TFLite conversion tutorial when it's published as it's non-trivial.
